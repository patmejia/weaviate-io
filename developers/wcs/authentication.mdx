There are two ways to connect to your Weaviate Cloud Services (WCS) instance:

- [Connect a browser to WCS through the WCS Console.](/developers/wcs/guides/authentication#connect-a-browser-to-wcs)
- [Connect a client application to WCS through APIs.](/developers/wcs/authentication#use-an-api-to-connect-to-wcs)

The WCS console is a multi-purpose tool. Login to manage your clusters, users, and billing. The built-in [GraphQL console](/developers/wcs/guides/console) is great for ad hoc queries. If you develop applications, or want additional flexibility, use the Weaviate API and one of the [client libraries](/developers/weaviate/client-libraries) to connect instead.

Browser authentication relies on a username and password. Client authentication uses API keys.

## Use a browser to connect to WCS

The WCS dashboard is an application that provides a browser-based mechanism to monitor and control your Weaviate clusters. It also provides account management tools and a [GraphQL query console](http://localhost:3000/developers/wcs/platform/console). To connect  to WCS with a browser, follow these steps.

1. If you don't a login account, [register a user](/developers/wcs/create-account) with WCS.
1. Open the [WCS login page](https://console.weaviate.cloud/) in a browser.
1. Click `Login to Weaviate Cloud Services`.
1. Enter your email address and password to authenticate. On subsequent visits, should be redirected to the login page automatically. 

### Enable multi-factor authentication (MFA)

 Multi-factor authentication increases the security of browser logins. To enable multi-factor authentication (MFA), follow these steps.

1. Use your browser to connect to the WCS console.
1. Click the silhouette of a person in the sidebar

3. Click the 'Manage Two-Factor Authentication' button.
1. Enter your username and password to authenticate to WCS.
1. Open your authenticator application and scan the QR code.
1. Enter the code from your application in WCS to complete the setup.

After you configure MFA, WCS prompts you to supply the one-time authentication code each time you log in.

![Enter MFA code](./img/mfa-one-time-code.jpg)

### MFA and applications

If you use a JavaScript or TypeScript client to connect an application to Weaviate, do not enable MFA for that account. There is no way to pass the the one-time authentication code, so the application cannot connect to WCS. Use API keys to connect client applications to WCS.

### Disable MFA

To disable MFA, [contact support](mailto:support@weaviate.io).

## Use an API to connect to WCS

By default, API keys are enabled for WCS  clusters. Managed clusters have an administrator key and a read-only key. Sandbox clusters only have an administrator key.

### Retrieve your API keys

To retrieve your API keys, follow these steps:

1. Open the WCS console and find the panel for your cluster.
1. Click the `Details` button.

3. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Copy the key and store it in a safe location.


## Steps for authentication

### An API key

To authenticate against Weaviate with an API key, each request needs to include the key in its header. The easiest way to do this is with a Weaviate client at instantiation, as shown in the code examples below:

import WCSAuthenticationApiKey from '/_includes/code/wcs.authentication.api.key.mdx';

<WCSAuthenticationApiKey/>

This way, every request made using the client will include the API key.

<details>
  <summary>Manually adding the key to the header.</summary>

If using a Weaviate client is not possible, you can manually include the API key in the request header as below:

```json
Authorization: Bearer YOUR-WEAVIATE-API-KEY
```

Replacing `YOUR-WEAVIATE-API-KEY` with your API key.

</details>







## Manage API keys

If you have a managed cluster, you can create and delete API keys. 

There are two types of API key, `ReadOnly` and `Admin`. `Admin` keys are read-write, the `ReadOnly` key does not grant write access to the database. 


### Create an API key

If you have a managed cluster, you can create new API keys. New API keys are not available in Sandbox clusters.

WCS restarts the cluster when you add a new API key. If you have a stand-alone cluster, you will have a short downtime while the cluster restarts. There is no downtime if you have a high availability cluster.

To create a new API key, follow these steps:

1. Click the `Details` button.
1. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Click `Add Key`.

4. Choose the key scope, read-only or admin.
1. Click `Generate` to create the key.

### Delete an API key

If you have a managed cluster, you can delete API keys.

WCS restarts the cluster when you delete an API key. If you have a stand-alone cluster, you will have a short downtime while the cluster restarts. There is no downtime if you have a high availability cluster.

To delete an API key, follow these steps:

1. Click the `Details` button.
1. Click the `API keys` button.
1. Click the trash-can icon to delete the API key.

### Weaviate console

:::info Automatic authentication for your WCS instances
If you are using the GraphQL console to query WCS instances under the same account, the console will automatically include the relevant credentials for you. In other words, your queries will be automatically authenticated.
:::

If you are querying an external Weaviate instance through the WCS console, you can pass authentication credentials (e.g. your API key) in this format:

```json title="Headers tab"
{ "Authorization": "Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" }
```

Pass the credentials as an additional header via the `Header` tab located towards the bottom of the console:

<img src={WCSHeadersAuth} width="100%" alt="WCS Headers Authorization Bearer example"/>

This will authenticate your requests against the Weaviate instance.

## Resetting credentials

- To reset your WCS password, you can do so [from WCS](https://console.weaviate.cloud) (click "Sign In" and then "Forgot Password").
